# OSS-Fuzz Integration Strategy - Gemini CLI

## Overview
This document outlines our phased approach to integrating Gemini CLI with OSS-Fuzz, designed to be maintainer-friendly and minimize risk.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Current PR)
**Goal**: Establish basic OSS-Fuzz infrastructure with minimal complexity

### Files Added:
- `project.yaml` - Basic Go fuzzing configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Minimal Go environment
- `build.sh` - 3 essential fuzz targets
- `.gitignore` - Exclude node_modules and build artifacts

### Fuzz Targets (3 total):
1. `FuzzConfigParser` - Configuration file parsing
2. `FuzzCLIParser` - Command-line argument parsing  
3. `FuzzInputSanitizer` - Input validation and sanitization

### Why This Phase:
- **Minimal Risk**: Only 3 fuzz targets, basic configuration
- **Easy Review**: Simple, focused changes
- **Foundation**: Establishes working OSS-Fuzz integration
- **Independent**: Doesn't depend on complex features

## Phase 2: Core Build System (Future PR)
**Goal**: Expand to 8-10 fuzz targets covering core functionality

### Planned Additions:
- `FuzzMCPRequest` - MCP protocol request parsing
- `FuzzMCPResponse` - MCP protocol response parsing
- `FuzzOAuthTokenRequest` - OAuth token request handling
- `FuzzOAuthTokenResponse` - OAuth token response handling
- `FuzzFileSystemOperations` - File system operations

### Why Independent:
- Builds on proven foundation
- Focuses on core CLI functionality
- Maintains simplicity

## Phase 3: Security-Critical Targets (Future PR)
**Goal**: Add high-priority security fuzz targets

### Planned Additions:
- `FuzzShellValidation` - Command injection prevention
- `FuzzSymlinkValidation` - Path traversal prevention
- `FuzzPathValidation` - Path validation
- `FuzzContextFileParser` - Context file parsing

### Why Independent:
- Security-focused
- Addresses specific vulnerabilities
- Can be prioritized based on security needs

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Coverage (Future PR)
**Goal**: Complete coverage with remaining fuzz targets

### Planned Additions:
- `FuzzURLParser` - URL parsing
- `FuzzCryptoOperations` - Cryptographic operations
- `FuzzEnvironmentParser` - Environment variable parsing
- `FuzzSlashCommands` - Slash command parsing
- `FuzzToolInvocation` - Tool invocation handling

### Why Independent:
- Completes coverage
- Builds on proven system
- Optional for basic security

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Maintainers:
- **Small, Focused PRs**: Easy to review and understand
- **Independent Changes**: Each phase can be merged separately
- **Risk Mitigation**: Issues can be isolated to specific phases
- **Clear Progression**: Logical build-up of functionality

### For Security:
- **Early Detection**: Foundation targets catch basic issues
- **Incremental Coverage**: Security improves with each phase
- **Prioritized Security**: Critical security targets in Phase 3
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full coverage in final phase

### For Development:
- **Working Foundation**: Phase 1 provides immediate value
- **Flexible Expansion**: Can add phases based on needs
- **Easy Rollback**: Can revert specific phases if needed
- **Clear Documentation**: Each phase is well-documented

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing:
- [ ] OSS-Fuzz trial build passes
- [ ] 3 fuzz targets compile successfully
- [ ] Basic seed corpora work
- [ ] No build errors or warnings

### Future Phase Testing:
- Each phase will be tested independently
- Build verification before PR submission
- Integration testing with previous phases

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Ready for review (current PR)
- **Phase 2**: After Phase 1 approval and testing
- **Phase 3**: After Phase 2 approval and testing  
- **Phase 4**: After Phase 3 approval and testing
